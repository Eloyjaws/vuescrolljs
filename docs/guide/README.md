## What is vuescroll

Vuescroll is a customizable scrollbar plugin based on Vue.js. It has two modes:

- Native: For PC , it supports basic custom scrollbars.

* Slide: Suitable for mobile terminal, supporting push-to-load, pull-to-refresh, carousel, etc.

However, this doesn't mean that the slide mode can only be used on the mobile side, just because the mobile side is more compatible with the slide mode.

## Why I created vuescroll

- Firstly, I think other scrollbar plugins' abilities are too simple, some others even don't support `horizontal scrolling`.

- Secondly, I think other scrollbar plugins's functions are too unitary, like `iscroll`, I want to make a more comprehensive scrollbar plugin. That is to say, a scrollbar plugin that not only supports customizing scrollbar, but also has abilities to push-to-load and pull-to-refresh, detect size changes of content, smooth-scroll etc.

## Feature

### Base Features

- Has abilities to [customize scrollbar](https://vuescrolljs.yvescoding.org/demo/#customize-scrollbar).

- Has abilities to [pull to refresh, push to load](https://vuescrolljs.yvescoding.org/demo/#pull-refresh-or-push-load).

- Support [carousel](https://vuescrolljs.yvescoding.org/demo/#carousel).

### Other Features

- Support [scrolling smoothly, and you can set different scrolling animations](https://vuescrolljs.yvescoding.org/guide/configuration.html#scrollpanel).

- Support [detection size changes of content and react to the users](https://vuescrolljs.yvescoding.org/guide/configuration.html#vuescroll).

- Support [typescript](https://vuescrolljs.yvescoding.org/guide/typescript.html#introduction), [SSR(Server-side-rendering)](https://vuescrolljs.yvescoding.org/demo/#ssr-server-side-rendering-demo).

- Because it is a Vue plugin, it's more friendly to Vue users.

- Restfull [Api](https://vuescrolljs.yvescoding.org/guide/api.html) and [events](https://vuescrolljs.yvescoding.org/guide/event.html) help you achieve all kinds of complex functions.

- And more...

## What else am I creating ?

- [magic-scroll](https://github.com/YvesCoding/magic-scroll) has the similar functions with vuescroll, but it's a customize scrollbar based on `React`.
